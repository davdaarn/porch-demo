- How long have you been with the company?
- How long do employees stick around before moving on?

## Story Notes

- I wanted to make sure I followed all directions diligently. In our last interview you expressed concern that I didn't read the requirements carefully.
- I wanted to submit a file with just the logic so that it would be easier to review.
- I spent the first 10 minutes researching if I could split the code into additional components when using Vue from a CDN. I didn't find a way that made since for the scope of the assignment.
- I preferred the approach of having comments stored with each blog post, my brain prefers to group related data, but I realize that isn't always the best approach. Looking back, other solutions could have been, having a separate key value store for the comments (that might have been more preformat, because Vue wouldn't need to do deep comparisons). Or, because only one post can be active at a time, I could have had just a variable for comments that is overwritten each time.
- I could have changed the behavior of the load comments button to say reload instead of just disappearing.
