<!-- 
As a Financial Professional selling software on the Porch Platform, I would like the ability to view my recent blog posts in order to 
review what I've written and see what my clients are saying about the content I am posting.

[x] AC: I can see a list of titles from my recent blog posts
[x] AC: Underneath each blog post title, there is a "View Post" button. When I click this button, the body of the blog post will become visible underneath the blog post title.
[x] AC: Once a blog post body is visible, the "View Post" button should change to read "Hide Post", and should be underneath the blog post body. 
[x] AC: When "Hide Post" is clicked, the body of the blog post is hidden, and "View Post" again is shown underneath the post title.
[x] AC: Only one blog post body should be visible at a time. If a blog post body is visible, and I click "View Post" on another blog post, the post that was open should close while the new blog post I just clicked on becomes visible.
[x] AC: When the body of a blog post is visible, I see another button labeled "Load Comments" at the bottom of the blog post body. When I click this button, the web app will load all the comments that have been made on that blog post (via API call) and display them underneath the blog post body.S
