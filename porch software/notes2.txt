## Notes on refactoring single file submission to cli application

Moved set isLoading statement to before the call to getComments to improve responsiveness of the UI.

Added Vuex as a state management pattern.

Created a view for recent posts
created a component for blog posts
Created a component for comments

The recent posts view handles getting posts and instantiating them.

Each blog post is responsible for it's own state, comments, dispatching actions.
